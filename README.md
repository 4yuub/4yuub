# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Ayoub](https://github.com/4yuub), a passionate and dedicated Software Engineer at BCG X.

## About Me

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer with almost two years of experience turning ideas into fully functional applications. Skilled in tools and languages like Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Docker, and Git, I specialize in full-stack development. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with backend frameworks like Django, FastAPI, and NestJS, as well as frontend technologies like Vue.js, React, and Next.js.
